**My new and ancient city**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e6ada94d-235e-495a-8ced-7fbfbd0f6c4a.jpg)

My new and ancient city  
of stacked secrets.  
Of lyrical, lonely  
afternoon cries.   
I wander through you,  
ever a stranger,  
forgetting my own history  
in favor of yours.  
Welcoming, welcoming  
_you are welcome_.  
Whatever you offer me,  
I have made.
