# **Your prisons, your mountains**

# 

I hold you in my heart, your prisons, your mountains, engraved on your face, the lines make maps of your skin.Guidesto the lost lands, where your fathers were born,to the other half of your smileto the stories that need more time to be told.to the lost lands where your fathers were born,

In my bones I know you,   
your invisible villages of dotted lights, tucked into the eroding hillsides of home.Remnants  
of your first glimpses behind closed doors,  
of the first breaking of your bones,  
of the places from which you stepped into the
world.
