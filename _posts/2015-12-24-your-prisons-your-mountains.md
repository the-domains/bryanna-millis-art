Your prisons, your mountains

I hold you in my heart, your prisons, your mountains, engraved on your face, the lines make maps of your skin.

Guides to the lost lands where your fathers were born  
to the other half of your smile  
to the stories that need more time to be told.  
In my bones I know you,   
your invisible villages of dotted lights, tucked into the eroding hillsides of home.
