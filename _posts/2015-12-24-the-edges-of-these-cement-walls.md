**The edges of these cement walls**

I am crumbling on my last day.  
Like the edges of these cement walls,  
I am battered by time.  
I have lost myself among the hours.  
I have forced patience into the blank spaces of days and nights.  
But the sun that rises is not my sun.  
Its cold light is indifferent and untrue.  
I open my hands and open my hands and open my hands,  
Ready to receive grace and let go.
