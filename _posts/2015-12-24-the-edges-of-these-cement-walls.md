**The edges of these cement walls**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/21965484-f421-469b-a1ef-cb933b1a148a.jpg)

I am crumbling on my last day.  
Like the edges of these cement walls.  
I am battered by time,  
I have lost myself among the hours,  
I have forced patience into the blank spaces of days and nights.  
But the sun that rises is not my sun.  
Its cold light is indifferent and untrue.  
I open my hands and open my hands and open my hands,  
Ready to receive grace and let go.
