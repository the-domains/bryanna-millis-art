**The water's edge I did not stand beside at sunset**
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/eaa1625d-0fa6-4b44-b0fd-5fc1448f5181.jpg)

My eyes yearn  
for the water's edge I did not   
stand beside at sunset  
as the world was changing  
and ever more the same.  
For the lightest of footprints  
I did not leave in the sand  
on my way there or back.  
My mouth longs  
for the coffee I did not   
drink in the morning light  
after a night spent   
confusing the present with eternity.  
For the long hands and lowered eyes   
of the waiter who did not set my cup   
so gently down.  
My heart aches  
for the city I did not   
love in summer  
the endless tangle of its history   
playing out across clattering stone streets.  
For the maps that did not show me the way  
to the memories that were never made.
